NUM_ELEVATORS = 2
NUM_FLOORS = 3
MAX_CAP = 2

Five types of people (start floor -> destination):

A (0 -> 2)
B (0 -> 1)
C (2 -> 0)
D (3 -> 1)
E (2 -> 3)


What elevators should do for each time step:

E1: stop. curr_floor = 0. load A and B. A, B on board.
E2: move up. curr_floor = 0

E1: move up. curr_floor = 1. A, B on board.
E2: move up. curr_floor = 1. empty. 

E1: stop. curr_floor = 1. unload B. A on board
E2: move up. curr_floor = 2. empty

E1: move up. curr_floor = 2. A on board.
E2: stop. curr_floor = 2. load E. E on board.

E1: stop. curr_floor = 2 unload A. load C. C on board.
E2: move up. curr_floor = 3. E on board

E1: move down. curr_floor = 1. C on board.
E2: stop. curr_floor = 3. unload E. load D. D on board.

E1: move down. curr_floor = 0. C on board. 
E2: move down. curr_floor = 2. D on board.

E1: stop. curr_floor = 0. unload C. empty.
E2: move down. curr_floor = 1. D on board.

E1: stop. curr_floor = 0. empty.
E2: stop. curr_floor = 1. unload D. empty.

E1: stop. curr_floor = 0. empty.
E2. stop. curr_floor = 1. empty.
